nuget2bazel
===========

Introduction
------------

Nuget packages often depend on other Nuget packages. By design, Bazel is
not able to determine Nuget dependencies at run time. That's why a
special tool is needed to extract those dependencies and list them
directly.

Moreover, Nuget packages are often built using different versions of the
framework. Please take into consideration [runtime limitations](runtime.md).

The tool
--------

The tool is used to generate rules_bazel compatible workspace rules for
nuget packages: [nuget_package](api.md#nuget_package). The tool maintains the list of
installed packages in package.json and appropriate rules in WORKSPACE
file. Sample usage:

> ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
> bazel run //tools/nuget2bazel:nuget2bazel.exe -- add -p c:/rules_dotnet ninject 3.3.0
>
> bazel run //tools/nuget2bazel:nuget2bazel.exe -- delete -p c:/rules_dotnet ninject 
> ```

By default the tool modifies WORKSPACE file in the provided directory
with proper directives.

However, typically it is more convenient to modify .bzl file to declare
dependencies in a separate function called in WORKSPACE. See for example
dotnet/private/deps/nuget.bzl.

To use custom nuget packages source two additional flags have to be
provided:

> ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
> bazel run //tools/nuget2bazel:nuget2bazel.exe -- add -p c:/rules_dotnet -u -n https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-corefxlab/api/v3/index.json System.Buffers.Primitives 0.1.2-e200127-1
> ```
>
The flag '-n' provides the url for the repository. The nuget2bazel
tools respects additional sources provided in
%APPDATA%/nuget/nuget.config.

The flag '-u' instructs the tool to generate the nuget_package rules
with additional variable set: "source = source". This makes possible
to provide additional to default nuget sources:

> ``` {.sourceCode .python}
> source = ["https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package", "https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-corefxlab/api/v2/package"]
> nuget_package(
>     name = "system.buffers.primitives",
>     package = "system.buffers.primitives",
>     version = "0.1.2-e200127-1",
>     sha256 = "47a5d3971de3d2f77beeec7421bf2d7414cfd3f3fa34147b836da58e50bd7213",
>     source = source,
> ...
> ```
>
Please note that the URLs provided in the source variable are not the
URLs to index.json API endpoint. These are URLs for downloading the
files by adding package name and version number.
